    "# Weak intermolecular interactions \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will examine some properties of weak interactions between molecules. As the molecular subunits are not connected by any covalent (or ionic) bonds, we often use the term *noncovalent interactions*. Suppose we want to calculate the interaction energy between molecule A and molecule B for a certain geometry of the A-B complex (obviously, this interaction energy depends on how far apart the molecules are and how they are oriented). The simplest way of doing so is by subtraction (in the so-called *supermolecular approach*):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{\\rm int}=E_{\\rm A-B}-E_{\\rm A}-E_{\\rm B}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{\\rm X}$ is the total energy of system X, computed using our favorite electronic structure theory and basis set. A negative value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that A and B have a lower energy when they are together than when they are apart, so they do form a weakly bound complex that might be stable at least at very low temperatures. A positive value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that the A-B complex is unbound - it is energetically favorable for A and B to go their separate ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of two interacting helium atoms and calculate $E_{\\rm int}$ at a few different interatomic distances $R$. You will use Psi4 to calculate the total energies that you need to perform subtraction. When you do so for a couple different $R$, you will be able to sketch the *potential energy curve* - the graph of $E_{\\rm int}(R)$ as a function of $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, but how should you pick the electronic structure method to calculate $E_{\\rm A-B}$, $E_{\\rm A}$, and $E_{\\rm B}$? Let's start with the simplest choice and try out the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. In case HF is not accurate enough, we will also try the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations - CCSD(T). If you haven't heard about CCSD(T) before, let's just state that it is **(1)** usually very accurate (it's even called the *gold standard* of electronic structure theory) and **(2)** very expensive for larger molecules. For the basis set, let's pick the augmented correlation consistent triple-zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis of Dunning which should be quite OK for both HF and CCSD(T).\n"

    "*Questions* \n",
    "1. Which curve makes more physical sense?\n",
    "2. Why does helium form a liquid at very low temperatures?\n",
    "3. You learned in freshman chemistry that two helium atoms do not form a molecule because there are two electrons on a bonding orbital and two electrons on an antibonding orbital. How does this information relate to the behavior of HF (which does assume a molecular orbital for every electron) and CCSD(T) (which goes beyond the molecular orbital picture)?\n",
    "4. When you increase the size of the interacting molecules, the CCSD(T) method quickly gets much more expensive and your calculation might take weeks instead of seconds. It gets especially expensive for the calculation of $E_{\\rm A-B}$ because A-B has more electrons than either A or B. Your friend suggests to use CCSD(T) only for the easier terms $E_{\\rm A}$ and $E_{\\rm B}$ and subtract them from $E_{\\rm A-B}$ calculated with a different, cheaper method such as HF. Why is this a really bad idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of the supermolecular approach is that it is very easy to use - you just need to run three standard energy calculations, and modern quantum chemistry codes such as Psi4 give you a lot of methods to choose from. However, the accuracy of subtraction hinges on error cancellation, and we have to be careful to ensure that the errors do cancel between $E_{\\rm A-B}$ and $E_{\\rm A}+E_{\\rm B}$. Another drawback of the supermolecular approach is that it is not particularly rich in physical insight. All that we get is a single number $E_{\\rm int}$ that tells us very little about the underlying physics of the interaction. Therefore, one may want to find an alternative approach where $E_{\\rm int}$ is computed directly, without subtraction, and it is obtained as a sum of distinct, physically meaningful terms. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is such an alternative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "SAPT is a perturbation theory aimed specifically at calculating the interaction energy between two molecules. Contrary to the supermolecular approach, SAPT obtains the interaction energy directly - no subtraction of similar terms is needed. Moreover, the result is obtained as a sum of separate corrections accounting for the electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange contributions to interaction energy, so the SAPT decomposition facilitates the understanding and physical interpretation of results.\n",
    "- *Electrostatic energy* arises from the Coulomb interaction between charge densities of isolated molecules.\n",
    "- *Induction energy* is the energetic effect of mutual polarization between the two molecules.\n",
    "- *Dispersion energy* is a consequence of intermolecular electron correlation, usually explained in terms of correlated fluctuations of electron density on both molecules.\n",
    "- *Exchange energy* is a short-range repulsive effect that is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will explore the simplest level of the SAPT theory called SAPT0 (see [Parker:2014] for the definitions of different levels of SAPT). A particular SAPT correction $E^{(nk)}$ corresponds to effects that are of $n$th order in the intermolecular interaction and $k$th order in the intramolecular electron correlation. In SAPT0, intramolecular correlation is neglected, and intermolecular interaction is included through second order:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{\\rm int}^{\\rm SAPT0}=E^{(10)}_{\\rm elst}+E^{(10)}_{\\rm exch}+E^{(20)}_{\\rm ind,resp}+E^{(20)}_{\\rm exch-ind,resp}+E^{(20)}_{\\rm disp}+E^{(20)}_{\\rm exch-disp}+\\delta E^{(2)}_{\\rm HF}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, the consecutive corrections account for the electrostatic, first-order exchange, induction, exchange induction, dispersion, and exchange dispersion effects, respectively. The additional subscript ''resp'' denotes that these corrections are computed including response effects - the HF orbitals of each molecule are relaxed in the electric field generated by the other molecule. The last term $\\delta E^{(2)}_{\\rm HF}$ approximates third- and higher-order induction and exchange induction effects and is taken from a supermolecular HF calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking to our example of two helium atoms, let's now calculate the SAPT0 interaction energy contributions using Psi4. In the results that follow, we will group $E^{(20)}_{\\rm ind,resp}$, $E^{(20)}_{\\rm exch-ind,resp}$, and $\\delta E^{(2)}_{\\rm HF}$ to define the total induction effect (including its exchange quenching), and group $E^{(20)}_{\\rm disp}$ with $E^{(20)}_{\\rm exch-disp}$ to define the total dispersion effect.\n"

    "For the next part, you will perform the same analysis and obtain the supermolecular and SAPT0 data for the interaction of two water molecules. We now have many more degrees of freedom: in addition to the intermolecular distance $R$, we can change the relative orientation of two molecules, or even their internal geometries (O-H bond lengths and H-O-H angles). In this way, the potential energy curve becomes a multidimensional *potential energy surface*. It is hard to graph functions of more than two variables, so we will stick to the distance dependence of the interaction energies. Therefore, we will assume one particular orientation of two water molecules (a hydrogen-bonded one) and vary the intermolecular distance $R$ while keeping the orientation, and molecular geometries, constant. The geometry of the complex has been defined for you, but you have to request all the necessary Psi4 calculations and extract the numbers that you need. To save time, we will downgrade the basis set to aug-cc-pVDZ and use MP2 (an approximate method that captures most of electron correlation) in place of CCSD(T).\n"

If the electrostatic contribution is repulsive, we can display the relative magnitudes of electrostatic, induction, and dispersion terms in the same way, but we need the second triangle (the left one).
