This lab activity is designed to teach students about weak intermolecular interactions, and the calculation and interpretation of the interaction energy between two molecules. The interaction energy can be broken down into physically meaningful contributions (electrostatics, induction, dispersion, and exchange) using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). In this exercise, we will calculate complete interaction energies and their SAPT decomposition using the procedures from the Psi4 software package, processing and analyzing the data with NumPy and Matplotlib.

Prerequisite knowledge: the Hartree-Fock method, molecular orbitals, electron correlation and the MP2 theory. The lab also assumes all the standard Python prerequisites of all Psi4Education labs.

Learning Objectives: 
1. Recognize and appreciate the ubiquity and diversity of intermolecular interactions.
2. Compare and contrast the supermolecular and perturbative methods of calculating interaction energy.
3. Analyze and interpret the electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange SAPT contributions at different intermolecular separations.

The teacher notebook has the complete Python code to generate all data and graph. The student notebook requires filling in the missing code parts marked by #COMPLETE.
